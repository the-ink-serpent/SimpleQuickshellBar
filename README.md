# SimpleQuickshellBar
Hey, had a hard time finding resources and using quickshell for Someone who dowesn't know QML. So for those who want to use it you can look at the config files to get started.<br>
Didn't use any packages to make it complex. Simple QML to learn.<br>
-> needs Hyprland for workspaces<br>
-> put the entire folder in the .config folder and run shell.qml with "qs -p path/to/file"<br>

/// add the lines to the hyprland.conf<br>

workspace = 1, persistent:true<br>
workspace = 2, persistent:true<br>
workspace = 3, persistent:true<br>
workspace = 4, persistent:true<br>
workspace = 5, persistent:true<br>

Primary trick -> Understand QML Rectangle and Layout
